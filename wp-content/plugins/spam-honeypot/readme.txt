Adds a hidden text field to the comment form to trap spam bots.

== Description ==

This plugin works by adding a textarea field to the comment form that's hidden
using a CSS style. Since bots don't generally detect CSS like this, they
proceed to fill out the field like any other field. This implies that they
aren't a human (or they wouldn't even see the field with CSS hiding it) being
using a browser, in which case the plugin marks the comment as spam. This
seems to catch the vast majority of spam with very few false results and
doesn't require contacting a third party service like most spam plugins.
